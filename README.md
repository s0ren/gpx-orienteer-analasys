# gpx-orienteer-analasys

# the idea
Stray idears of analyzing orienteering track data to evaluate training effort in the catagories:
* runningspeed
* of-road running
* orienteering capabilities
    * overall
    * near orienteering  
Yet i'am not sure how much info i can get from tracking data

## goals

* identify streches with possible improvement in 
    * runningspeed
        * on paths/roads
        * running in rough
    * orinteering skills
        * trafic light, green-yellow-red
        * near-orienteering, time spend near the post
        * stops during run (looking at maps or landscape)
        * identify detours
